        The Five Pillars of Islam are the foundation of Muslim life and faith. They include: 
        <ol>
          <li>Shahada (declaration of faith)</li>
          <li>Salat (prayer)</li>
          <li>Zakat (almsgiving)</li>
          <li>Sawm (fasting)</li>
          <li>Hajj</li>
        </ol>
        <span class="right-side-p">
          (pilgrimage to Mecca). These pillars provide a framework for worship, social responsibility, and spiritual growth. The Shahada is the declaration of belief in one God and the prophethood of Muhammad. Salat involves ritual prayer five times a day. Zakat is the giving of a portion of wealth to those in need. Sawm is fasting during the month of Ramadan. Hajj is a pilgrimage to Mecca that is required once in a lifetime for those who are physically and financially able.
